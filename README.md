Personal project to create smallest guitar hero controller.

I'm building a guitar hero (clone hero) controller with the bare minimum functions (frets and strum bar) and I'm trying to make it as small and compact as I can.
I'm using an RP2040 and followed the minimal hardware design doc from RasPi as reference. 
It's my first time designing a board just using components and no breakouts. 

Using JLCPCB for manufacturing and assembly of SMT components.
Soldering THT components myself.

Using the Santroller Configurator to program RP2040 firmware.
