Personal project to create smallest guitar hero controller.

I'm building a guitar hero (clone hero) controller with the bare minimum functions (frets and strum bar) and I'm trying to make it as small and compact as I can.
I'm using an RP2040 and followed the minimal hardware design doc from RasPi as reference. 
It's my first time designing a board just using components and no breakouts. 

Using JLCPCB for manufacturing and assembly of SMT components. DFM checks tailored to their requirements.
Soldering THT components myself.

Using the Santroller Configurator to program RP2040 firmware.

My reference for size is the Nintendo DS version of Guitar Hero which came with a controller attachment specifically for the Nintendo DS Lite that connects into the GBA port on the bottom to use the fret buttons. My goal being that the final product is less in volume than a Nintendo DS Lite 211,603mm^3.

The case was modeled in Fusion 360 with a final volume of 38,031mm^3.
Using JLC3DP for 3D printing.

Future plans: Add gyro and wammy bar.
